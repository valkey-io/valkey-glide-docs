## What GLIDE Provides Out-of-the-Box

### 🚀 **Zero-Configuration Reliability**
```java
// GLIDE - Works reliably with minimal setup
GlideClient client = GlideClient.createClient(
    GlideClientConfiguration.builder()
        .address(NodeAddress.builder().host("localhost").port(6379).build())
        .build()
).get();

// Automatic circuit breaking, retries, and failover - no additional code needed
```

### 📊 **Built-in Observability**
```java
// GLIDE - Metrics available immediately
ConnectionPoolStats stats = client.getConnectionPoolStats();
System.out.println("Active connections: " + stats.getActiveConnections());
System.out.println("Failed requests: " + stats.getFailedRequests());
System.out.println("Average latency: " + stats.getAverageLatency());
```

### 🌐 **Intelligent Read Routing**
```java
// GLIDE - Configure read preferences easily
GlideClientConfiguration config = GlideClientConfiguration.builder()
    .readFrom(ReadFrom.REPLICA_PREFERRED) // Prefer replicas for reads
    .build();
```

### 🔄 **Automatic Connection Management**
```java
// GLIDE - Connection multiplexing handled automatically
// No need to manage connection pools, sizing, or lifecycle
CompletableFuture<String> result = client.get("key");
```
