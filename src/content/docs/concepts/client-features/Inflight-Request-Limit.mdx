title: Inflight Request Limit

To ensure system stability and prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors, Valkey GLIDE limits the maximum number of concurrent (inflight) requests sent through each connection of a GLIDE client.
Excessive inflight requests can lead to queuing within the GLIDE infrastructure, increasing memory usage and potentially causing OOM issues.
By capping inflight requests per connection, this feature reduces the risk of excessive queuing and helps maintain reliable system performance.
The default inflight request limit is 1000 per connection, though this value can be configured in all GLIDE wrappers to suit application needs.

The limit is designed based on Little’s Law, ensuring that the system can operate efficiently at peak throughput while allowing a buffer for bursts. 
* Maximum request rate: 50,000 requests/second.
* Average response time: 1 millisecond.
Using Little’s Law:
* Inflight requests = (Request rate) × (Response time)
* Inflight requests = 50,000 requests/second × (1 ms/1000 ms) = 50 requests

A default value of 1000 allows for sufficient headroom above this calculated baseline, ensuring performance during short bursts of activity.
When the inflight request limit is exceeded, excess requests are immediately rejected, and errors are returned to the client.
