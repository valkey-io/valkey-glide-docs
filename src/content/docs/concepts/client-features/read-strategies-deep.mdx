By default, Valkey GLIDE directs read commands to the primary node that owns a specific slot. For applications that prioritize read throughput and can tolerate possibly stale data, Valkey GLIDE provides the flexibility to route reads to replica nodes.

Valkey GLIDE provides support for next read strategies, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your specific use case.

|Strategy	|Description	|
|---	|---	|
|`PRIMARY`	|Always read from primary, in order to get the freshest data	|
|`PREFER_REPLICA`	|Spread requests between all replicas in a round robin manner. If no replica is available, route the requests to the primary	|
|`AZ_AFFINITY`	|Spread the read requests between replicas in the same client's availability zone in a round robin manner, falling back to other replicas or the primary if needed.	|
|`AZ_AFFINITY_REPLICAS_AND_PRIMARY`	|Spread the read requests among nodes within the client's availability zone in a round robin manner, prioritizing local replicas, then the local primary, and falling back to other replicas or the primary if needed.	|
