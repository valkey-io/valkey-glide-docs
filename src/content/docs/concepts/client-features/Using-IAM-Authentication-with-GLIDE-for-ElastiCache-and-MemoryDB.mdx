Connecting to an ElastiCache or MemoryDB cluster configured with IAM Authentication using GLIDE, requires: 

1. Generating an IAM Authentication token using AWS SDK. 
2. Initializing the GLIDE client by passing the IAM token as part of the credentials configuration.
3. Refreshing the token periodically with GLIDEâ€™s Dynamic Password Update Feature.

See how to generate the token and GLIDE user examples in [Python](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/Python-wrapper#example---using-iam-authentication-with-glide-for-elasticache-and-memorydb), [Java](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/Java-Wrapper#example---using-iam-authentication-with-glide-for-elasticache-and-memorydb) and [Node.js](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/NodeJS-wrapper#example---using-iam-authentication-with-glide-for-elasticache-and-memorydb). 

### Best Practices for Refreshing IAM Tokens and Re-authentication
GLIDE supports dynamic updates to the password in the connection configuration at runtime (see [Dynamic Password Management](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#dynamic-password-management) for more details). This capability is required when using IAM authentication because: 

* IAM tokens are only valid for 15 minutes.
* Connections authenticated with IAM must be re-authenticated every 12 hours using the AUTH or HELLO command with a fresh IAM token. Otherwise, the connection will be terminated.

To efficiently manage this, GLIDE provides the ability to update short-lived tokens using `updateConnectionPassword` (or `update_connection_password`) to periodically refresh the token without immediately re-authenticating. It also offers the option for immediate re-authentication using `immediateAuth` (or `immediate_auth`), which forces re-authentication and extends the connection for another 12 hours.

**Best Practices** 

* Refresh the IAM token every 10 minutes using `updateConnectionPassword` without triggering immediate re-authentication.
* Perform an immediate re-authentication every 10 hours to prolong the connection for another 12-hour window.

This approach ensures seamless token management and connection stability when using IAM authentication with GLIDE.
