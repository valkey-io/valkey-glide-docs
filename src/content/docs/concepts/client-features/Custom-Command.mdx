The `custom_command` function is designed to execute a single command without checking inputs. It serves as a flexible tool for scenarios where the standard client API does not provide a suitable interface for a specific command.

#### Usage Notes:

- **Single-Response Commands Only**: This function is intended for use with commands that return a single response. Commands that do not return a response (such as SUBSCRIBE), those that potentially return multiple responses (such as XREAD), or those that alter the client's behavior (such as entering pub/sub mode on RESP2 connections) should not be executed using this function.

- **Key-Based Command Limitation**: Key-based commands should not be used with multi-node routing. Ensure that key-based commands are routed to a single node to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected behavior.
