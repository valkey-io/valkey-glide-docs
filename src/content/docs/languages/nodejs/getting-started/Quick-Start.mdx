# Quick Start

## Installation

```bash
npm i @valkey/valkey-glide
```

## Basic Examples

#### Standalone Mode:

```typescript
import { GlideClient, GlideClusterClient, Logger } from "@valkey/valkey-glide";
// When Valkey is in standalone mode, add address of the primary node, and any replicas you'd like to be able to read from.
const addresses = [
    {
        host: "localhost",
        port: 6379,
    },
];
// Check `GlideClientConfiguration/GlideClusterClientConfiguration` for additional options.
const client = await GlideClient.createClient({
    addresses: addresses,
    // if the server uses TLS, you'll need to enable it. Otherwise, the connection attempt will time out silently.
    // useTLS: true,
    // It is recommended to set a timeout for your specific use case
    requestTimeout: 500, // 500ms timeout
    clientName: "test_standalone_client",
});
// The empty array signifies that there are no additional arguments.
const pong = await client.customCommand(["PING"]);
console.log(pong);
const set_response = await client.set("foo", "bar");
console.log(`Set response is = ${set_response}`);
const get_response = await client.get("foo");
console.log(`Get response is = ${get_response}`);
```

#### Cluster Mode:

```typescript
import { GlideClient, GlideClusterClient, Logger } from "@valkey/valkey-glide";
// When Valkey is in cluster mode, add address of any nodes, and the client will find all nodes in the cluster.
const addresses = [
    {
        host: "localhost",
        port: 6379,
    },
];
// Check `GlideClientConfiguration/GlideClusterClientConfiguration` for additional options.
const client = await GlideClusterClient.createClient({
    addresses: addresses,
    // if the cluster nodes use TLS, you'll need to enable it. Otherwise the connection attempt will time out silently.
    // useTLS: true,
    // It is recommended to set a timeout for your specific use case
    requestTimeout: 500, // 500ms timeout
    clientName: "test_cluster_client",
});
// The empty array signifies that there are no additional arguments.
const pong = await client.customCommand(["PING"], { route: "randomNode" });
console.log(pong);
const set_response = await client.set("foo", "bar");
console.log(`Set response is = ${set_response}`);
const get_response = await client.get("foo");
console.log(`Get response is = ${get_response}`);
client.close();
```
