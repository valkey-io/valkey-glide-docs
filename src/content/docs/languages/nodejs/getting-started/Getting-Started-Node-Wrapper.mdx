# Getting Started - Node Wrapper

## System Requirements

The release of Valkey GLIDE was tested on the following platforms:

### Linux GNU

Linux with **glibc 2.17** or higher.

### MacOS (Darwin)

MacOS Apple Silicon/aarch_64 and x86_64/amd64.

- Full tests are running on MacOS 15.0 arm64/aarch64
- Minimal tests are running on: MacOS 13.5 x86*64/amd64*(We do not recommend using MacOS Intel for production, It is supported for development purposes)\_

### Alpine

All alpine versions that are using _musl libc_ 1.2.3 (All Alpine non deprecated alpine versions) or higher should be supported.
Tests are running on:

- node:alpine (x86_64/amd64 and arm64/aarch64)

## NodeJS supported version

Node.js 16 or higher.
**For npm users on linux it is recommended to use npm >=11 since it support optional download base on libc, yarn users should not be concerned**

- Note: The library is dependent on the [protobufjs library](https://protobufjs.github.io/protobuf.js/#installation), which add a size to the package. The package is using the protobufjs/minimal version, hence, if size matter, bundlers should be able to strip the unused code. It should reduce the size of the dependency from 19kb gzipped to 6.5kb gzipped.

### Building & Testing

Development instructions for local building & testing the package are in the [DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/node/DEVELOPER.md#build-from-source) file.
