### Command String Arguments

Valkey strings are stored in its simplest form: as a sequence of bytes. GLIDE offers [GlideString](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/79fdec50bbef4310cb12e46a69f14c18378afb44/node/src/BaseClient.ts#L278) which maps to Valkey strings. Use it to pass Valkey strings as arguments to commands, or receive Valkey strings in response to commands. GlideString represents either:

1. `string`: as a UTF-8 encoded string.
2. `Buffer`: as a `byte[]`.

The return types of command API:

-   Command uses `string` instead of `GlideString` as the return type if it contains a simple string value (simple strings in Valkey are always UTF-8 encoded strings). For example, [`type`](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/79fdec50bbef4310cb12e46a69f14c18378afb44/node/src/BaseClient.ts#L4488) command returns one of pre-defined strings, or [`set`](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/79fdec50bbef4310cb12e46a69f14c18378afb44/node/src/BaseClient.ts#L1182) command which returns `"OK"`.
-   Command uses `Buffer` as the return type, because it always contains binary data. For example, `dump` and `functionDump` commands.
-   Most commands use `GlideString` as the common return type.
