### Tracking resources

GLIDE 1.2 introduces a new NONE Valkey API: `getStatistics` which returns an `Object` with (currently) 2 properties (available for both `GlideClient` & `GlideClusterClient`):

- `total_connections` contains the number of active connections across **all** clients
- `total_clients` contains the number of active clients (regardless of its type)

```ts
import {GlideClusterClient} from "@valkey/valkey-glide";

const addresses = [
    {
        host: "address.example.com",
        port: 6379
    }
];

const client = await GlideClusterClient.createClient({
    addresses: addresses,
    requestTimeout: 500
});

// Retrieve statistics
const stats = await client.getStatistics();

// Example: Accessing and printing statistics
console.log(`Total Connections: ${stats.total_connections}`);
console.log(`Total Clients: ${stats.total_clients}`);
