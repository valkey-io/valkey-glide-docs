### TLS

Valkey GLIDE supports secure TLS connections to a data store.

It's important to note that TLS support in Valkey GLIDE relies on [rusttls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls). Currently, Valkey GLIDE employs the default rustls settings with no option for customization.

#### Example - Connecting with TLS Mode Enabled to a Cluster

```typescript
import {GlideClusterClient} from "@valkey/valkey-glide";

const addresses = [
    {
        host: "address.example.com",
        port: 6379
    }
];

const client = await GlideClusterClient.createClient({
    addresses: addresses,
    useTLS: true
});
```
#### Example - Connecting with TLS Mode Enabled to a Standalone

```typescript
import {GlideClient} from "@valkey/valkey-glide";

const addresses = [
    {
        host: "address.example.com",
        port: 6379
    }
];

const client = await GlideClient.createClient({
    addresses: addresses,
    useTLS: true
});
```
