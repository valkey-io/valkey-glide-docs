### Timeouts and Reconnect Strategy

Valkey GLIDE allows you to configure timeout settings and reconnect strategies. These configurations can be applied through the [`GlideClusterClientConfiguration`](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/java/client/src/main/java/glide/api/models/configuration/GlideClusterClientConfiguration.java) and [`GlideClientConfiguration`](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/java/client/src/main/java/glide/api/models/configuration/GlideClientConfiguration.java) parameters.


|Configuration setting	|Description	|**Default value**	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|requestTimeout	|This specified time duration, measured in milliseconds, represents the period during which the client will await the completion of a request. This time frame includes the process of sending the request, waiting for a response from the node(s), and any necessary reconnection or retry attempts. If a pending request exceeds the specified timeout, it will trigger a timeout error. If no timeout value is explicitly set, a default value will be employed.	|250 milliseconds	|
|reconnectStrategy	|The reconnection strategy defines how and when reconnection attempts are made in the event of connection failures.	|Exponential backoff	|


#### Example - Setting Increased Request Timeout for Long-Running Commands

```java
import glide.api.GlideClusterClient;
import glide.api.models.configuration.GlideClusterClientConfiguration;
import glide.api.models.configuration.NodeAddress;

GlideClusterClient config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration.builder()
    .address(NodeAddress.builder()
        .host("address.example.com")
        .port(6379).build())
    .requestTimeout(500)
    .build();

GlideClusterClient client = GlideClusterClient.createClient(config).get();
```
