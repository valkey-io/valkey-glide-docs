## Client Initialization

Valkey GLIDE provides support for both [Cluster](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/Java-wrapper#cluster) and [Standalone](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/Java-wrapper#standalone) and configurations. Please refer to the relevant section based on your specific setup.

### Cluster

Valkey GLIDE supports [Cluster](https://valkey.io/topics/cluster-spec) deployments, where the database is partitioned across multiple primary shards, with each shard being represented by a primary node and zero or more replica nodes.

To initialize a [`GlideClusterClient`](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/java/client/src/main/java/glide/api/GlideClusterClient.java), you need to provide a [`GlideClusterClientConfiguration`](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/java/client/src/main/java/glide/api/models/configuration/GlideClusterClientConfiguration.java) that includes the addresses of initial seed nodes. Valkey GLIDE automatically discovers the entire cluster topology, eliminating the necessity of explicitly listing all cluster nodes.

#### **Connecting to a Cluster**

The `NodeAddress` class represents the host and port of a cluster node. The host can be either an IP address, a hostname, or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

#### Example - Connecting to a cluster

```java
import glide.api.GlideClusterClient;
import glide.api.models.configuration.GlideClusterClientConfiguration;
import glide.api.models.configuration.NodeAddress;

NodeAddress address = NodeAddress.builder()
    .host("address.example.com")
    .port(6379)
    .build();

GlideClusterClientConfiguration config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration.builder()
    .address(address)
    .build();

GlideClusterClient clusterClient = GlideClusterClient.createClient(config).get();
```

#### Request Routing

In the cluster, data is divided into slots, and each primary node within the cluster is responsible for specific slots. Valkey GLIDE adheres to [Valkey OSS guidelines](https://valkey.io/topics/command-tips/#request-policy) when determining the node(s) to which a command should be sent in clustering mode. 

For more details on the routing of specific commands, please refer to [the documentation within the code](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/java/client/src/main/java/glide/api/models/configuration/RequestRoutingConfiguration.java) for routing configuration.

#### Response Aggregation

When requests are dispatched to multiple shards in a cluster (as discussed in the Request routing section), the client needs to aggregate the responses for a given command. Valkey GLIDE follows [Valkey OSS guidelines](https://valkey.io/topics/command-tips/#response-policy) for determining how to aggregate the responses from multiple shards within a cluster. 

To learn more about response aggregation for specific commands, please refer to [the documentation within the code](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/blob/main/java/client/src/main/java/glide/api/models/ClusterValue.java).

#### Topology Updates

The cluster's topology can change over time. New nodes can be added or removed, and the primary node owning a specific slot may change. Valkey GLIDE is designed to automatically rediscover the topology whenever the server indicates a change in slot ownership. This ensures that the Valkey GLIDE client stays in sync with the cluster's topology.

### Standalone 

Valkey GLIDE also supports Standalone deployments, where the database is hosted on a single primary node, optionally with replica nodes. To initialize a `GlideClient` for a standalone setup, you should create a `GlideClientConfiguration` that includes the addresses of primary and all replica nodes.

#### **Example - Connecting to a standalone** 

```java
import glide.api.GlideClient;
import glide.api.models.configuration.GlideClientConfiguration;
import glide.api.models.configuration.NodeAddress;

GlideClientConfiguration config = GlideClientConfiguration.builder()
    .address(NodeAddress.builder()
        .host("primary.example.com")
        .port(6379)
        .build())
    .address(NodeAddress.builder()
        .host("replica1.example.com")
        .port(6379)
        .build())
    .address(NodeAddress.builder()
        .host("replica2.example.com")
        .port(6379)
        .build())
    .build();

GlideClient standaloneClient = GlideClient.createClient(config).get();
```
