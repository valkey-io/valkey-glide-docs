### Tracking resources

GLIDE 1.2 introduces a new NONE Valkey API: `getStatistics` which returns a `Dict` with (currently) 2 properties (available for both `GlideClient` & `GlideClusterClient`):

- `total_connections` contains the number of active connections across **all** clients
- `total_clients` contains the number of active clients (regardless of its type)

```python
from glide import (
    NodeAddress,
    GlideClusterClientConfiguration,
    GlideClusterClient
)

addresses = [NodeAddress(host="address.example.com", port=6379)]
client_config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration(addresses, request_timeout=500)

client = await GlideClusterClient.create(client_config)

# Retrieve statistics
stats = await client.get_statistics()

# Example: Accessing and printing statistics
print(f"Total Connections: {stats['total_connections']}")
print(f"Total Clients: {stats['total_clients']}")
```
