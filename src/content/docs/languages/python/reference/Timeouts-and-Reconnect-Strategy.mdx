### Timeouts and Reconnect Strategy

Valkey GLIDE allows you to configure timeout settings and reconnect strategies. These configurations can be applied through the `GlideClusterClientConfiguration` and `GlideClientConfiguration` parameters.


|Configuration setting	|Description	|**Default value**	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|request_timeout	|This specified time duration, measured in milliseconds, represents the period during which the client will await the completion of a request. This time frame includes the process of sending the request, waiting for a response from the node(s), and any necessary reconnection or retry attempts. If a pending request exceeds the specified timeout, it will trigger a timeout error. If no timeout value is explicitly set, a default value will be employed.	|250 milliseconds	|
|reconnect_strategy	|The reconnection strategy defines how and when reconnection attempts are made in the event of connection failures	|Exponential backoff	|


#### Example - Setting Increased Request Timeout for Long-Running Commands

```python
from glide import (
    GlideClient,
    GlideClusterClientConfiguration,
    GlideClusterClient
)

addresses = [NodeAddress(host="address.example.com", port=6379)]
client_config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration(addresses, request_timeout=500)

client = await GlideClusterClient.create(client_config)
```
