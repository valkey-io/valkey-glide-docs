### TLS

Valkey GLIDE supports secure TLS connections to a data store.

It's important to note that TLS support in Valkey GLIDE relies on [rusttls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls). Currently, Valkey GLIDE employs the default rustls settings with no option for customization.

#### Example - Connecting with TLS Mode Enabled to a Cluster

```python
from glide import (
    GlideClusterClient,
    GlideClusterClientConfiguration,
    NodeAddress
)

addresses = [NodeAddress(host="address.example.com", port=6379)]
client_config = GlideClusterClientConfiguration(addresses, use_tls=True)

client = await GlideClusterClient.create(client_config)
```
#### Example - Connecting with TLS Mode Enabled to a Standalone server

```python
from glide import (
    GlideClient,
    GlideClientConfiguration,
    NodeAddress
)

addresses = [
    NodeAddress(host="primary.example.com", port=6379),
    NodeAddress(host="replica1.example.com", port=6379),
    NodeAddress(host="replica2.example.com", port=6379)
  ]
client_config = GlideClientConfiguration(addresses, use_tls=True)

client = await GlideClient.create(client_config)
```
